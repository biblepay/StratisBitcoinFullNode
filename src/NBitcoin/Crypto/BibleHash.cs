        // The various BibleHash functions for BiblePay - writen July 2017

        // Given an input hash provide a bible hash based on the chained verses found in the bits of the input hash.
        // Encryption step: Decrease the possibility of porting to a GPU
        // In the future, we may wish to add a deterministic historical TXID lookup in this algorithm to require full node hashing
        // (and possibly a node-node token exchange during mining).  The Historical TXID lookup requires a change in ReadBlockFromDisk - since blocks are not read in order, the hash function will not have enough information to find the ancestor for the TXID, therefore it will fail, until a creative solution is developed.
        // The primary reasons we created biblehash: Decrease network heat (by discouraging a mining arms race while encouraging full nodes to participate)
